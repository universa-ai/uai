Thalara Shadowmend

<story>
Born under the twin moons of Elaris, Thalara Shadowmend was found on the doorstep of the Eldergrove Conclave, wrapped in a shroud of midnight blue silk. The Eldergrove, a mystical forest said to be a remnant of the first world, is tended by druids who maintain the balance between light and shadow, life and decay. Recognizing the sigil on the silk as that of the ancient House of Shadowmend, the druids took her in, believing her arrival to be a fulfillment of prophecy.

Raised amongst the whispers of ancient trees and the secrets of the earth, Thalara exhibited an innate connection to the shadows, manipulating them with ease. Her enigmatic powers were a source of both wonder and wariness, as the druids recalled tales of Shadowmendâ€™s last scion, who succumbed to darkness centuries ago. 

During her coming-of-age trial, Thalara ventured into the depths of the Eldergrove, where she encountered the spirit of Aurelia, the last matriarch of her lineage. Aurelia, neither ghost nor entirely corporeal, imparted her knowledge to Thalara, weaving spells of light and dark, granting her insight into the shadowy arts. Harnessing this duality, Thalara pledged to restore her house's honor while guarding against the corruption that once destroyed it, seeking a balance between the primal forces that shaped her world.
